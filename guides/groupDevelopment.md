## Community Development

Originally, hapijs/university started as a distributed learning experiment to teach people coding skills as a group.  
Excitingly, as a group, the university developed a solid hapijs application. Thus, the project also became sample code 
showing people new to hapi how to build a hapijs application. 

As the university moves forward, we will still code as a group.
To do this, we will periodically:

* Issue an assignment<br/>
  See [Issues List Here](https://github.com/hapijs/university/issues), in this list look 
  for the issue labelled "assignment". That issue will describe the requirements of 
  the current assignment.  At anytime the issue list may contain: a newly issued 
  assignment, discussion about the next assignment, or list maintenance work to be done.
* Anyone is welcome to fork the project, write code fulfilling assignment requirements and submit a PR.
* **Review of Assignments** <br/>
  After PRs are submitted, we peer review each others PRs and learn from critiques.<br/>
  Look at what others are submitting and see if you can improve your own solution (borrow ideas, add tests, write examples, update the documentation).  If you see ways in which others can improve their solution, comment on their Pull Request. The time you spend reviewing code
will have a direct result on how much you learn. It is called: "learning sideways". Everyone is a teacher and a learner. Studying someone else's code will improve your code. And, your critique of another's code will improve their code.<br/><br/>
  There are *three types of PRs* the university is concerned with:
  * *personalPR*<br/>
    Often, many PRs are submitted as a potential solution for an assignment. These PRs are called "personalPRs".  
    Everyone is encouraged to submit a personalPR and provide peer reviews of PRs submitted by others.  
    Specific explanations and hints can be given inside someone's personalPR. Much learning is accomplished
    through this peer review process. Additionally, one of the personalPRs submitted will be selected and labelled as the "communityPR". 

  * *communityPR*<br/>
    When working on a community assignment look for a PR labelled "communityPR".  
    The "communityPR" label signifies the PR is for the community and contains: 
    - discussion related to core concepts of the lesson.
    - a high quality solution for the assignment. 
    - discussion related to the thought process behind the solution.  

    Having a "communityPR" allows for assignment discussion and notes to be kept in one place. This provides a form of 
    living documentation for each assignment.  Participants can see a high quality solution and notes regarding it. 
    Importantly, having a "communityPR" also allows for experienced developers to keep pace with the most important discussion topics and 
    contribute with minimal effort.  

  * *solutionPR*<br/>
  Only one PR will be accepted as the solution for an assignment and merged into the master branch.  All other PRs will be labelled 
  "assignment" and closed. 

* Choose a Solution<br/>
  At the end of an assignment and peer review process, we will have a nice refined solution that may be merged into the project.
  Discussion about which PR to accept as the solution is welcomed. If there is no agreement the university maintainer will decide.
  Of course, if there is an expert developer who wants to determine the best solution they are always welcome. Hint, hint.... [hapi team](https://github.com/orgs/hapijs/people) your
  input is welcome :-)
* Merge in the solutionPR and move on to the next assignment.
* Before starting the next assignment, make sure [your fork matches the current master](git.md) since only one Pull Request can be accepted.
